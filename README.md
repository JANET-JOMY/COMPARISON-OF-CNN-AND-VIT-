# COMPARISON-OF-CNN-AND-VIT-
This repository presents a comprehensive comparative study between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT) on the Fruit-360 dataset. The study evaluates both models in terms of classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score across multiple epochs. Key aspects such as confusion matrices, error analysis, and batch-wise performance are thoroughly examined to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. The implementation includes the use of a batch size of 276 over 3 epochs, focusing on the nuances of model performance. The repository provides insights into the potential of ViT in achieving higher classification accuracy, especially in the context of visually similar categories. This analysis aims to guide researchers and practitioners in choosing the appropriate model architecture for automated classification tasks.
